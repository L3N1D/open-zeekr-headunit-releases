/**
 * What to ask the phone for when the only radio this unit has is a 2.4 GHz one.
 *
 * [com.lenid.zoh.aap.protocol.messages.ServiceDiscoveryResponse] announces one video
 * configuration, and the protocol has no bitrate field: resolution, 30-versus-60 fps and the codec
 * are the whole of what we can ask for less of. Audio has one lever, AAC instead of PCM, and on
 * such a link uncompressed music is the largest stream, so the cap covers it too.
 *
 * **This used to only advise.** Two units have now produced the same failure - the phone joins,
 * opens the video channel and closes the socket seconds later having sent no frame at all - and on
 * the second the radio has no 5 GHz band at all, so the band is not a remedy anyone can reach. A
 * lower profile held on the same access point in both cases, so the cap is now applied and
 * [Settings.narrowBandProfileCap] is how a user who disagrees turns it off.
 *
 * **A third reason was added for platforms that cannot be asked**, below API 21, where
 * `is5GHzBandSupported` does not exist and no transport reports a frequency: both inputs read
 * absent, so the cap could never fire on the oldest hardware, which is the hardware least able to
 * carry a full-rate stream. That arm rests on **one** measured unit, an Android 4.4.2 tablet that
 * died repeatedly at 1080p and held 720p indefinitely, not on the two the arms above have. The
 * same opt-out covers it and [advice] says exactly what was done.
 *
 * Pure, so the wording and every gate are a unit test rather than a device.
